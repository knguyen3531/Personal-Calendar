# Personal-Calendar

Absolutely, here's a simplified explanation of what's been done in the HTML and JavaScript code:

HTML:

Created a web page with a title: "Work Day Scheduler."
Included external CSS stylesheets for Bootstrap, Font Awesome icons, and a custom stylesheet.
Added a header with a title and description for the calendar app.
Created time blocks for scheduling events from 9 AM to 5 PM.
Each time block includes a label for the hour, a textarea for entering events, and a save button.
Time blocks are structured for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM.
JavaScript:

Used jQuery to ensure the JavaScript code runs when the document is ready.
Displayed the current date at the top of the calendar and updated it every minute.
Color-coded time blocks based on the current time, distinguishing between past, present, and future hours.
Loaded saved events from local storage into the corresponding time blocks.
Allowed users to save event text to local storage when the save button is clicked.
Initialized the application by calling necessary functions.
Set up interval timers to refresh the display and colors every minute for real-time updates.
